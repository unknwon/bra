```

## FAQs

### How to I gracefully shutdown the application?

Change following values in your `.bra.toml`:

```toml
[run]
interrupt_timout = 15
graceful_kill = true
```

This will send `os.Interrupt` signal first and wait for `15` seconds before force kill.

## Configuration

An example configuration take form [gogsweb](https://github.com/gogits/gogsweb):

```
[run]
init_cmds = [["./gogsweb"]]       # Commands run in start
watch_all = true                  # Watch all sub-directories
watch_dirs = [                    # Directories to watch
  "$WORKDIR/conf",
  "$WORKDIR/models",
  "$WORKDIR/modules",
  "$WORKDIR/routers"
]
watch_exts = [".go", ".ini"]      # Extensions to watch
env_files = [".env"]              # Load env vars from file
ignore = [".git", "node_modules"] # Directories to exclude from watching
ignore_files = []                 # Regexps for ignoring specific notifies
follow_symlinks = false           # Enable/disable following symbolic links of sub directories
build_delay = 1500                # Minimal interval to Trigger build event
cmds = [                          # Commands to run
  ["go", "install"],
  ["go", "build"],
  ["./gogsweb"]
]
```
